I constructed Reservoir (without any ``Class" setting!) and realtime filter (based on Bayesian optimization) code. 

If you want to know the mathematical structure of this realtime filter, see the following paper:

``Long-term prediction of El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation using reservoir computing with data-driven realtime filter"
